# Metadata

One of the main benefits of working with kloppy is that it loads metadata with the event data. This metadata includes teams (name, ground and provider id) and players (name, jersey number, optional position and provider id). Using this metadata, it becomes very easy to create an analysis that is usable by humans, because it includes names instead of only numbers.
