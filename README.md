## What is it?

Each data provider uses its own proprietary formats, event definitions, and coordinate system to capture soccer match data. This **lack of standardization** makes it difficult to build software or perform analysis across multiple providers. Kloppy solves this challenge by introducing a **vendor-independent data model** for both **event and tracking data**. It also streamlines data preprocessing, ensuring **seamless integration into your data analysis and video analysis workflows**. By standardizing and simplifying access to soccer match data, kloppy aims to be an essential building block for anyone working with soccer data.

## Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that kloppy does well.

#### 1. Loading data
Kloppy implements a **standardized data model** that can load event and tracking data from the **most common data providers**, supporting both public and proprietary data. Moreover, it does not matter where or how the data is stored: kloppy can handle **compressed files** and load data directly from **the cloud**.

```python
from kloppy import sportec

dataset = sportec.load_open_event_data(match_id="J03WMX")
```

#### 2. Querying data 

Video analysts spend a lot of time searching for bespoke moments. Often, these moments follow recognizable patterns—like pass, pass, shot. Kloppy provides a **powerful search mechanism** based on regular expressions, enabling you to find these bespoke moments more quickly and easily.

```python
goals = dataset.filter("shot.goal")
```

#### 3. Transforming data 
Different data providers use different coordinate systems, which can make combining datasets challenging. Additionally, it can be convenient to change the orientation of the data or normalize pitch dimensions for specific analyses. Kloppy handles these **data transformations** seamlessly.

```python
goals_ltr = goals.transform(
    to_coordinate_system="opta",
    to_orientation="ACTION_EXECUTING_TEAM"
)
```

#### 4. Exporting data
Once your data is in the right shape, export it as **a Polars or Pandas dataframe** for efficient analysis, or as **SportsCode XML** to support your video analysis workflow. Kloppy's data model is also **compatible with other popular soccer analytics libraries**.

```python
df_goals = goals_ltr.to_df(
  "player", 
  "coordinates_*", 
  assist=lambda event: event.prev("pass"),
  engine="polars"
)
```
