# Selectors

!!! example "TODO"

    This section will introduce the selector methods available in Kloppy: `find`, `find_all`, `next`, `prev`, and `filter`. These methods allow for traversal of event datasets making it easy to extract specific events of interest.

    Topics to cover:

    - Overview of each selector:
        - `find`: return the first match
        - `find_all`: return all matching elements
        - `filter`: return a new dataset
        - `next`: get the next event after a given one
        - `prev`: get the previous event
    - Selector accept a string or a custom function
    - Combining selectors for sequence-based logic
